# Final project: "Paris: Beyond the Illusion of La Cité de l’Amour"

## Purpose
Paris is usually associated with fashion, elegance, luxury, love and many other cliches. However, the reality is certainly different. This project aims to: 

1) Explore some of the realities of the city in order to prepare tourists to what they will encounter when visiting "la cité de l'amour" and avoid the Paris syndrome

2) Allow the visitors to choose their accommodation in Paris according to the kind of the experience they want to live 

To achieve this, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard where users can filter Airbnb listings based on:  
- **Number of guests**  
- **Price range**  
- **Experience type**: Luxury, Bohemian, Cultural, or Nightlife  

They can also explore curated activities (hidden gems) tailored to their chosen experience  

By breaking down these assumptions with real data, this project provides a data-driven approach to discovering Paris in a more personalized way.  

## Findings

**Population distribution**: Busting the first myth – not all Parisians can see the Eiffel Tower from their window. Most people live far from the main landmarks.

**Weather**: Rain in Paris is as frequent as in London. In fact, in 2024, Paris had more rainy days than London.

**Safety**:Crime seems to have decreased in the last two years, with drug use, fraud, and intentional destruction/degradation being the most common crimes. As for theft, most cases are non-violent.

## Future Steps
✅ **Expand accommodations**: Add hotels so users can compare different types of stays 

✅ **Deeper analysis**: Explore additional aspects of Paris, such as affordability and cultural diversity
